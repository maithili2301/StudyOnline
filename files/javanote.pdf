Java Programming Language
Java Is One Of The Most Popular And Widely Used Programming Languages. Java Has Been One Of The Most Popular Programming Languages For Many Years.
 Java Is Object Oriented. However, It Is Not Considered As Pure Object-Oriented As It Provides Support For Primitive Data Types (Like Int, Char, Etc)
 The Java Codes Are First Compiled Into Byte Code (Machine-Independent Code). Then The Byte Code Runs On Java Virtual Machine (JVM) Regardless Of The
 Underlying Architecture. Java Syntax Is Similar To C/C++. But Java Does Not Provide Low-Level Programming Functionalities Like Pointers. Also, Java Codes Are
 Always Written In The Form Of Classes And Objects. Java Is Used In All Kinds Of Applications Like Mobile Applications (Android Is Java-Based), Desktop Applications,
 Web Applications, Client-Server Applications, Enterprise Applications, And Many More. When Compared With C++, Java Codes Are Generally More Maintainable Because 
Java Does Not Allow Many Things Which May Lead To Bad/Inefficient Programming If Used Incorrectly. For Example, Non-Primitives Are Always References In Java. So We 
Cannot Pass Large Objects (Like We Can Do In C++) To Functions, We Always Pass References In Java. One More Example, Since There Are No Pointers, Bad Memory Access 
Is Also Not Possible. When Compared With Python, Java Kind Of Fits Between C++ And Python. 
The Programs Are Written In Java Typically Run Faster Than Corresponding Python Programs And Slower Than C++. Like C++, Java Does Static Type Checking,
 But Python Does Not. Simple Hello World Program : 
// A Java Program To Print "Hello World"
 Public Class GFG { 
Public Static Void Main(String Args[])
 { System.Out.Println("Hello World");
 } }

Variables In Java
Variable In Java Is A Data Container That Saves The Data Values During Java Program Execution. Every Variable Is Assigned A Data Type That Designates The Type
 And Quantity Of Value It Can Hold. Variable Is A Memory Location Name Of The Data.
 A Variable Is A Name Given To A Memory Location. It Is The Basic Unit Of Storage In A Program.  Java Foundation And Collections Concepts With The Fundamentals
 Of Java And Java Collections Course At A Student-Friendly Price And Become Industry Ready. To Complete Your Preparation From Learning A Language To DS Algo 
And Many More, Please Refer Complete Interview Preparation Course. The Value Stored In A Variable Can Be Changed During Program Execution. 
A Variable Is Only A Name Given To A Memory Location, All The Operations Done On The Variable Effects That Memory Location. 
In Java, All The Variables Must Be Declared Before Use. How To Declare Variables? We Can Declare Variables In Java As Pictorially Depicted Below As A Visual Aid.


From The Image, It Can Be Easily Perceived That While Declaring A Variable, We Need To Take Care Of Two Things That Are:

Datatype: Type Of Data That Can Be Stored In This Variable.
Dataname: Name Was Given To The Variable.
In This Way, A Name Can Only Be Given To A Memory Location. It Can Be Assigned Values In Two Ways:

Variable Initialization
Assigning Value By Taking Input
How To Initialize Variables?

It Can Be Perceived With The Help Of 3 Components That Are As Follows:

Datatype: Type Of Data That Can Be Stored In This Variable.
Variable_name: Name Given To The Variable.
Value: It Is The Initial Value Stored In The Variable.

Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) Concept In Java
As The Name Suggests, Object-Oriented Programming Or OOPs Refers To Languages That Uses Objects In Programming. Object-Oriented Programming Aims To Implement 
Real-World Entities Like Inheritance, Hiding, Polymorphism Etc In Programming. The Main Aim Of OOP Is To Bind Together The Data And The Functions That
 Operate On Them So That No Other Part Of The Code Can Access This Data Except That Function. Let Us Do Discuss Pre-Requisite By Polishing Concepts Of Methods
 Declaration And Passing. Starting Off With The Method Declaration, It Consists Of Six Components: Attention Reader! Donâ€™t Stop Learning Now. Get Hold Of All

Ready. To Complete Your Preparation From Learning A Language To DS Algo And Many More, Please Refer Complete Interview Preparation Course. 
Access Modifier: Defines Access Type Of The Method I.E. From Where It Can Be Accessed In Your Application. In Java, There 4 Type Of The Access Specifiers.
 Public: Accessible In All Class In Your Application. Protected: Accessible Within The Package In Which It Is Defined And In Its Subclass(Es)(Including Subclasses
 Declared Outside The Package) Private: Accessible Only Within The Class In Which It Is Defined. Default (Declared/Defined Without Using Any Modifier): Accessible
 Within Same Class And Package Within Which Its Class Is Defined. The Return Type: The Data Type Of The Value Returned By The Method Or Void If Does Not Return
 A Value. Method Name: The Rules For Field Names Apply To Method Names As Well, But The Convention Is A Little Different. Parameter List: Comma Separated List
 Of The Input Parameters Are Defined, Preceded With Their Data Type, Within The Enclosed Parenthesis. If There Are No Parameters, You Must Use
 Empty Parentheses (). Exception List: The Exceptions You Expect By The Method Can Throw, You Can Specify These Exception(S).
 Method Body: It Is Enclosed Between Braces. The Code You Need To Be Executed To Perform Your Intended Operations. Message Passing: Objects Communicate With One
 Another By Sending And Receiving Information To Each Other. A Message For An Object Is A Request For Execution Of A Procedure And Therefore Will Invoke
 A Function In The Receiving Object That Generates The Desired Results. Message Passing Involves Specifying The Name Of The Object, The Name Of The Function And 
The Information To Be Sent. Now With Basic Prerequisite To Step Learning 4 Pillar Of OOPS Is As Follows. Let Us Start With Learning About The Different
 Characteristics Of An Object-Oriented Programming Language
